Siva Tuitions and Coachings - static single-page site

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind CSS static site intended as a digital business card for "Siva Tuitions and Coachings".

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:/Users/nellu/OneDrive/Desktop/clients data/Siva tutuions and coacahing/siva-site"
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Notes:
- Phone number in the app has been updated to the provided number: 08879797777 (international format used: +91-8879797777).
- The map iframe uses the exact Google Maps embed code provided. If you'd like an API-based interactive map or a place-specific embed using a Maps API key, I can add that.
- To build a production static site run `npm run build` and host the `dist/` folder on any static host.

Colors used (as requested):
- Blue text: #6495ed

If you want I can:
